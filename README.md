## API Usage

```
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/check -d '{"url": "https://google.fr", "pattern": "find me", "insecure": false, "timeout": 20}
{
  "http_status": "200 OK",
  "http_status_code": 200,
  "http_body_pattern": true,
  "http_request_time": 119,
  "instance_name": "X250",
  "dns_lookup": 9,
  "tcp_connection": 6,
  "tls_handshake": 52,
  "server_processing": 43,
  "content_transfer": 6,
  "timeline": {
    "name_lookup": 9,
    "connect": 16,
    "pretransfer": 68,
    "starttransfer": 112
  },
  "geo": {
    "country": "US",
    "ip": "216.58.209.227"
  },
  "ssl": true,

  "ssl_days_left": 74
}
```

* If pattern is not filled `http_body_pattern` is always `true`
* `tls_handshake`, `ssl_expiry_data` and `ssl_days_left` are not shown when `http://` only
